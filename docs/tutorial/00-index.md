# The World's Greatest Effection Tutorial

**Learn structured concurrency by building a multiplex HTTP proxy**

---

## What You'll Learn

Ever written async code that leaked connections, orphaned timers, or left servers running after Ctrl+C? You're not alone. JavaScript's `async/await` feels great—until it doesn't.

Effection is a structured concurrency library that fixes this by guaranteeing:

1. **No operation runs longer than its parent** - automatic cleanup
2. **Every operation exits fully** - `finally` blocks always run
3. **It's just JavaScript** - use `if`, `for`, `while`, `try/catch` as normal

By the end of this tutorial, you'll build a **multiplex HTTP proxy** that dynamically spawns Express servers and routes requests through a switchboard - all managed by Effection.

### Part 5: Capstone - Multiplex HTTP Proxy

- [5.1 Architecture Overview](./12-capstone-architecture.md) - What we're building
- [5.2 Express Server Resource](./13-capstone-server-resource.md) - Wrapping Express as a resource
- [5.3 Server Pool](./14-capstone-server-pool.md) - Managing dynamic servers

## Prerequisites

- Solid JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- Familiarity with `async/await`
- Basic understanding of Node.js
- Experience with Express is helpful but not required

---

## Setup

```bash
npm install effection
```

For the capstone project, you'll also need:

```bash
npm install express
npm install -D @types/express tsx typescript
```

---

## Running Examples

All code examples are written in TypeScript and can be run with:

```bash
npx tsx <filename>.ts
```

Make sure your `tsconfig.json` has:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```
