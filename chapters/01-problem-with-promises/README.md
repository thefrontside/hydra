# Chapter 1.1: The Problem with Promises

Before we dive into Effection, we need to understand **why it exists**.

JavaScript's `async/await` is like a house with no fire exits—everything looks fine until there's an emergency. The problems aren't obvious at first, but they become painful at scale.

---

## The Leaky Timer

Consider this simple race between two timers:

```typescript
// leaky-race.ts
async function sleep(ms: number): Promise<void> {
  await new Promise<void>((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

async function main(): Promise<void> {
  console.time("race");
  await Promise.race([sleep(10), sleep(1000)]);
  console.timeEnd("race");
}

main();
```

**Quiz**: How long does this program take to exit in Node.js?

**Answer**: About 1000ms, not 10ms!

Even though `Promise.race()` resolves after 10ms, the second `setTimeout` callback is still registered on the event loop. Node.js won't exit until all callbacks fire.

This is a **leaked effect** - a piece of asynchronous work that outlives its usefulness.

---

## The Await Event Horizon

Here's an even scarier problem:

```typescript
// await-event-horizon.ts
async function doWork(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await new Promise<void>((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100000));
  } finally {
    console.log("Cleaning up..."); // Will this run?
  }
}

const promise = doWork();

// Simulate user pressing Ctrl+C after 1 second
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Exiting...");
  process.exit(0);
}, 1000);
```

**Output**:

```
Exiting...
```

The cleanup code **never runs**! When the process exits, all pending promises are simply abandoned. This is called the **Await Event Horizon** - once you enter an `await`, there's no guarantee your `finally` block will execute.

---

## Real-World Consequences: EADDRINUSE

You've probably seen this error:

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

This happens because:

1. Your server starts listening on port 3000
2. Something crashes or you hit Ctrl+C
3. The cleanup code that calls `server.close()` never runs
4. You restart your app and the port is still bound

The "solution" developers use? Kill processes manually, wait, or pick a different port. This is madness!

---

## The Mental Shift

With traditional async programming, we think:

> "An asynchronous operation will run **as long as it needs to**"

Effection flips this:

> "An asynchronous operation runs **only as long as it's needed**"

When an operation's parent completes, all children are automatically halted. When you press Ctrl+C, cleanup code is **guaranteed** to run.

---

## A Taste of the Solution

Here's the same timer race in Effection:

```typescript
// effection-race.ts
import { main, sleep, race } from "effection";

await main(function* () {
  console.time("race");
  yield* race([sleep(10), sleep(1000)]);
  console.timeEnd("race");
});
```

**Output**:

```
race: 10ms
```

The program exits after 10ms! When `race()` completes, it automatically cancels the losing sleep operation, including cleaning up its `setTimeout`.

---

## Guaranteed Cleanup

And here's the cleanup example:

```typescript
// guaranteed-cleanup.ts
import { main, sleep } from "effection";

await main(function* () {
  try {
    yield* sleep(100000);
  } finally {
    console.log("Cleaning up..."); // ALWAYS runs!
  }
});

// Ctrl+C triggers graceful shutdown
```

Press Ctrl+C and you'll see:

```
Cleaning up...
```

Effection guarantees that `finally` blocks run, even during shutdown.

---

## Mini-Exercise: Experience the Pain

Create a file called `leaky-timers.ts` and run it:

```typescript
// leaky-timers.ts
const timers: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>[] = [];

async function createLeakyTimer(id: number, ms: number): Promise<void> {
  await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Timer ${id} fired after ${ms}ms`);
      resolve();
    }, ms);
    timers.push(timerId);
  });
}

async function main(): Promise<void> {
  console.log("Starting race...");
  console.time("total");

  await Promise.race([
    createLeakyTimer(1, 100),
    createLeakyTimer(2, 200),
    createLeakyTimer(3, 500),
    createLeakyTimer(4, 1000),
  ]);

  console.log("Race finished! But watch what happens...");
  console.timeEnd("total");

  // We'd need to manually clean up:
  // timers.forEach(id => clearTimeout(id));
}

main();
```

Run it: `npx tsx leaky-timers.ts`

Notice how all 4 timers fire even though only timer 1 "won" the race. Comment in the cleanup line at the end to see the "fix" - but imagine having to do this everywhere in a large codebase!

## Key Takeaways

The house with no fire exits:

1. **Promises leak** - `Promise.race()` and `Promise.all()` don't cancel losers
2. **Finally blocks aren't guaranteed** - process exit abandons pending work (the fire exit is locked)
3. **Manual cleanup is error-prone** - you'll forget, and you'll get bitten
4. **Structured concurrency solves this** - operations are bound to their parent's lifetime (proper fire exits everywhere)
